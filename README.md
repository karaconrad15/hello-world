Hi, I'm Kara! I am from Lexington, NC, and I'm super excited to begin my grad school journey this fall in the OMDS program at BU. I am a UNC-Chapel Hill alum and currently work as the Advancement Data Specialist at High Point University. I love dogs, going to coffee shops, scrolling through Pinterest, and playing pickleball.
